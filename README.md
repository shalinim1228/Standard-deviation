Basic Statistical Analysis using Python
This project is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to calculate basic statistical measures using the statistics module. The script computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, and median for a predefined dataset.

Features:
Mean Calculation: Computes the average value of the dataset.
Variance Calculation: Computes the variance, which measures the spread of the data points.
Standard Deviation Calculation: Computes the standard deviation, which indicates the amount of variation or dispersion of the data points.
Median Calculation: Computes the median, which is the middle value in the sorted dataset.
How It Works:
Data Input: A predefined list of numerical data is provided in the script.
Statistical Computation:
Mean: Calculated using st.mean(data).
Variance: Calculated using st.variance(data).
Standard Deviation: Calculated using st.stdev(data).
Median: Calculated using st.median(data).
Output: The computed statistical values are printed to the console.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script.
bash
Copy code
python basic_statistics.py
The script will print the mean, variance, standard deviation, and median of the dataset.
Future Enhancements:
Extend the script to accept user input for the dataset.
Implement additional statistical measures like mode, range, and quartiles.
Create a graphical representation of the data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
